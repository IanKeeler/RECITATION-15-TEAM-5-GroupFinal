TA meeting notes week 1: 
-for creating fake data we dont want to have skewed data, should be able to have someone input their data during presentation

-by the end of week 2, break into teams of UI and backend, use website to randomize data and have that data in create.sql to test, 
-what are we going to do for next week -  registration login password, lock in what we want to finish functionalities, should be just about finished by week 3
- do a global leaderboard instead of random people that just shares all user data in order
